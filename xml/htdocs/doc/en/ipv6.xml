<title>Preliminaries</title>
<section>
<title>Basic Kernel Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Any of the 2.6 kernel trees availables in Gentoo will easily support IPv6
connections. The new USAGI IPv6 stack is integrated to the kernel since Linux
2.6.0.
</p>

<pre caption="Emerging a kernel">
# <i>emerge gentoo-sources</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we are ready to enter the kernel source directory and begin our
actual kernel configuration.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring the Linux Kernel">
# <i>cd /usr/src/linux</i>
# <i>make menuconfig</i>
</pre>

<note>
This assumes the symlink <path>/usr/src/linux</path> points to the
sources you will be using.

<title>Testing IPv6 Support</title>
<body>

<p>
After enabling the recommended options, recompile your kernel and reboot
into your new IPv6-enabled kernel.
</p>

<p>
If you don't already have <b>iproute2</b> installed, we urge you to do it now.
iproute2 is a network configuration suite that contains <c>ip</c>, the famous
replacement for <c>ifconfig</c>, <c>route</c>, <c>iptunnel</c> and others...
</p>

<pre caption="Installing iproute2">
# <i>emerge sys-apps/iproute2</i>
</pre>

<warn>
Use of ifconfig can cause serious headaches if you have multiple tunnel
devices. You have to remove the tunnels in backorder, which means that the
latest created must be removed first. You have been warned!
</warn>

<p>
If IPv6 is working, the loopback device should show an IPv6 address:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the loopback device">
# <i>ip -6 addr show lo</i>
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP&gt; mtu 16436
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    <comment>(The above lines show things are working)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
Before going any further, make sure that you add <e>ipv6</e> to your list of
USE variables in <path>make.conf</path>, so that future emerges of packages
will include IPv6 support.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>Tunnel Configuration</title>
<section>
<title>Basic Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Most ISPs still do not offer any native IPv6 connections. To get around
this limitation, there are several "tunnel brokers" around the globe
that offer free IPv6 tunnels. This will allow you to tunnel all your
IPv6 connections through an IPv4 connection.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Broker</th><th>Location</th></tr>
<tr>
  <ti><uri link="http://tunnelbroker.net/">Hurricane Electric</uri></ti>
  <ti>North America, Europe, Asia</ti>

<tr>
  <ti><uri link="http://gogonet.gogo6.com/">Freenet6</uri></ti>

  <ti>Australia/South Pacific</ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Below are two examples for setting up a tunnel with two popular North
American tunnels, Hurricane Electric (applies for non-heartbeat tunnels
from sixxs.net as well) and Freenet6.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Hurricane Electric</title>
<body>

<p>
Hurricane Electric (HE for short) offers free IPv6 tunnels and allocates
a /64 block of addresses for you. It also allows configuration of
reverse DNS. Getting a tunnel from HE is as easy as going to
<uri>http://www.tunnelbroker.net/</uri> and filling out a one page form.
</p>

<note>
Registration includes listing information like your address and phone
number.
</note>

<p>
After you have a tunnel approved and have a /64 block allocated, you can
configure your Gentoo box. HE provides sample configurations based on
ifconfig and the iproute utilities. The following two examples assume
you have the following configuration:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <ti>Local IPv4 Address (eth0)</ti><ti>68.36.91.195</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>HE IPv4 Address</ti><ti>64.71.128.82</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>Local IPv6 tunnel Address</ti><ti>2001:470:1F00:FFFF::189</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti>IPv6 Block</ti><ti>2001:470:1F00:296::/64</ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Using the iproute2 package and the <c>ip</c> command, you would do the
following:
</p>

<pre caption="Configuration of an IPv6 tunnel">
<comment>(Create a tunnel between the local (eth0) IPv4 and HE's remote IPv4 address)</comment>
# <i>ip tunnel add sixbone mode sit remote 64.71.128.82 local 68.36.91.195 ttl 64 dev eth0</i>
<comment>(Extract the tunneling overhead from the MTU)</comment>
# <i>ip link set sixbone mtu 1280</i>
<comment>(Bring the tunnel up)</comment>

<comment>(Route all global unicast IPv6 addresses through our 'sixbone' tunnel device)</comment>
# <i>ip route add 2000::/3 dev sixbone</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Freenet6</title>
<body>

<p>
<uri link="http://gogonet.gogo6.com/">Freenet6</uri> is another free tunnel
broker. Optional registration only requires a username and a valid email
address. They have chosen to turn the tunnel management into a client/server
setup and have created the <c>gateway6</c> client. The client is available in
Portage. To install it do:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing the Freenet6 client">
# <i>emerge gateway6</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now if you chose to connect with authentification, you need to configure
<c>gateway6</c> by editing <path>/etc/gateway6/gw6c.conf</path>. You should only
have to change the <e>userid</e> and <e>passwd</e> fields to match those
assigned from Freenet6 and change the gateway server. Below is a sample config
file.
</p>

<pre caption="gw6c.conf example">
auth_method=any
<i>userid=anonymous</i>
<i>passwd=foobar</i>
template=linux
server=broker.freenet6.net
</pre>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Testing your connection</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your tunnel is configured, you can test your connection. The
easiest way to do this is to use the <c>ping6</c> utility and try to ping
an IPv6 host.
</p>

<pre caption="Testing the connection">
# <i>emerge iputils</i>
# <i>ping6 www.kame.net</i>

</pre>

<p>
Further work is currently in progress to add better IPv6 support to the
network init scripts. If you'd like to know the status of this and/or

<title>IPv6 Support in Applications</title>

<section>
<title>Re-emerging packages</title>
<body>

<p>
Unless you had <e>USE="ipv6"</e> in your <path>/etc/portage/make.conf</path>
previously, you probably need to re-emerge a bunch of packages to compile in
IPv6 support for them. To get a list of all the installed packages which are
affected by USE flag changes, use Portage's <c>--newuse</c> (<c>-N</c>) option:
</p>

<pre caption="Candidates for re-emerging">
# <i>emerge -uDNav world</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you have changed a lot of USE flags, the list could be quite long. It's
suggested to keep your system up-to-date, so it won't hurt if you recompile
all affected packages.
</p>

<note>
Some packages detect IPv6 support automagically and hence have no ipv6 USE
flag. Thus not all packages, which should support IPv6, will support it if
you have not compiled it with an IPv6 enabled kernel.
</note>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>IPv6 Specific Packages</title>
<body>

<p>
There are a few packages which specifically deal with IPv6 items. Most
of these are located in <path>/usr/portage/net-misc</path>.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <ti>net-misc/ipv6calc</ti>
  <ti>Converts an IPv6 address to a compressed format</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>net-misc/netcat6</ti>

  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

</chapter>

<chapter>
<title>DNS setup</title>
<section>
<title>IPv6 and DNS</title>
<body>

<p>
Just as DNS for IPv4 uses A records, DNS for IPv6 uses AAAA records.
(This is because IPv4 is an address space of 2^32 while IPv6 is an
address space of 2^128). For reverse DNS, the INT standard is deprecated
but still widely supported. ARPA is the latest standard. Support for the
ARPA format will be described here.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>BIND configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Recent versions of BIND include excellent IPv6 support. This section
will assume you have at least minimal knowledge about the configuration
and use of BIND. We will assume you are not running bind in a chroot.
If you are, simply append the chroot prefix to most of the paths in the
following section.
</p>

<p>
First you need to add entries for both forward and reverse DNS zone files
in <path>/etc/bind/named.conf</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="named.conf entries">
<comment>(We allow bind to listen to IPv6 addresses.</comment>
<comment>Using 'any' is the only way to do it prior to bind-9.3)</comment>
options {
    [...]
    listen-on-v6 { any; }
    [...]
};
<comment>(This will provide the forward DNS for the domain 'ipv6-rules.com':)</comment>
zone "ipv6-rules.com" IN {
    type master;
    file "pri/ipv6-rules.com";
};
<comment>(This format for reverse DNS is "bitwise." It's done by taking the IPv6 prefix,</comment>
<comment>reversing the order of the numbers and putting a period between each number)</comment>
zone "6.9.2.0.0.0.f.1.0.7.4.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "pri/rev-ipv6-rules.com.arpa";
};
</pre>

<p>
Now we must create those zone files and add entries for all of our
hosts:
</p>

<pre caption="pri/ipv6-rules.com">
$TTL    2h
@       IN      SOA     ipv6-rules.com. webmaster.ipv6-rules.com.  (

<title>DJBDNS configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
There are currently some third-party patches to DJBDNS available at
<uri>http://www.fefe.de/dns/</uri> that allow it to do IPv6 nameserving. DJBDNS
can be installed with these patches by emerging it with <e>ipv6</e> in your USE
variables.
</p>

<warn>
Not all record types are support yet with these patches. In particular,
NS and MX records are not supported.
</warn>

<pre caption="Installing djbdns">
# <i>emerge djbdns</i>
</pre>

<p>
After djbdns is installed, it can be setup by running
<c>tinydns-setup</c> and answering a few questions about which IP
addresses to bind to, where to install tinydns, etc.
</p>

<pre caption="Setting up tinydns">
# <i>tinydns-setup</i>
</pre>

<p>
Assuming we've installed <c>tinydns</c> into <path>/var/tinydns</path>,
we can now edit <path>/var/tinydns/root/data</path>. This file will contain
all the data needed to get tinydns handling DNS for your IPv6 delegation.
</p>

<pre caption="sample data file">
<comment>(*.ipv6-rules.com is authoritatively handled by 192.168.0.1)</comment>
.ipv6-rules.com:192.168.0.1:a:259200
<comment>(Authoritative reverse DNS for 2001:470:1f00:296::/64)</comment>

</pre>

<p>
Lines prefixed with a <c>6</c> will have both an AAAA and a PTR record
created. Those prefixed with a <c>3</c> will only have an AAAA record
created. Besides manually editing the <path>data</path> file, you can
use the scripts <c>add-host6</c> and <c>add-alias6</c> to add new entries.
After changes are made to the <path>data</path> file, you simply need to
run <c>make</c> from <path>/var/tinydns/root</path>. This will create
<path>/var/tinydns/root/data.cfb</path>, which tinydns will use as its
source of information for DNS requests.
</p>

<chapter>
<title>IPv6 Router</title>
<section>
<title>Configure routing</title>
<body>

<p>
Further configuration is required if we want to use our system as a
router for other clients wishing to connect to the outside world with
IPv6. We need to enable forwarding of IPv6 packets. We can do this in
one of two ways.
</p>

<pre caption="Enabling forwarding">
# <i>echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding</i>
or
# <i>sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1</i>
</pre>

<warn>
The <c>radvd</c> init script explained in the next chapter enables (and
disables) forwarding, making the next step unnecessary.
</warn>

<p>
To enable forwarding at boot, you'll need to edit
<path>/etc/sysctl.conf</path> and add the following line.
</p>

<pre caption="sysctl.conf addition">
<comment>(If you will be using radvd, this step is unnecessary)</comment>
net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1
</pre>

<p>
Traffic should now be forwarded from this box through the tunnel we've
established with our broker.
</p>

<p>
To assign IPv6 addresses to clients, the IPv6 specification allows for
both stateless and stateful IP assignment. Stateless assignment uses a
process called Router Advertisement and allows clients to obtain an IP
and a default route by simply bringing an interface up. It is called
"stateless" because there is no record of IPs assigned and the host they
are assigned to. Stateful assignment is handled by DHCPv6. It is
"stateful" because the server keeps a state of the clients who've
requested IPs and received them.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Stateless Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
Stateless configuration is easily accomplished using the Router
Advertisement Daemon, or <c>radvd</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Configuring radvd">
# <i>emerge radvd</i>
</pre>

<p>
After having emerged <c>radvd</c>, we need to create
<path>/etc/radvd/radvd.conf</path> that contains information about what
IP block to assign IPs from. Here is a sample <path>radvd.conf</path>
file using the prefix we've been assigned from our tunnel broker.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample radvd.conf">
interface eth1
{
        <comment>(Send advertisement messages to other hosts)</comment>
        AdvSendAdvert on;
        <comment>(Fragmentation is bad(tm))</comment>
        AdvLinkMTU 1280;
        MaxRtrAdvInterval 300;
        <comment>(IPv6 subnet prefix we've been assigned by our PoP)</comment>
        prefix 2001:470:1F00:296::/64
        {
                AdvOnLink on;
                AdvAutonomous on;
        };
};
</pre>

<warn>
Make sure the interface on the first line is correct so you broadcast router
advertisement to your intranet and not to your ISP!
</warn>

<p>
Further information is available in <c>man radvd.conf</c>. We can now
start <c>radvd</c> and set it to start at boot.
</p>

<pre caption="Starting up radvd">
# <i>/etc/init.d/radvd start</i>
# <i>rc-update add radvd default</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Stateful Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
If you'd like to have stateful configuration, you'll need to install and
configure <c>net-misc/dibbler</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Installing dibbler">
# <i>emerge dibbler</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now we must configure the dibbler client by editing
<path>/etc/dibbler/client.conf</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="Sample dibbler client configuration">
iface ppp0 {
	rapid-commit yes
	pd
	option dns-server
}
</pre>

<p>
We can now start the dibbler client, and configure it to start at boot.
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the dibbler client">
# <i>/etc/init.d/dibbler-client start</i>
# <i>rc-update add dibbler-client default</i>

<title>IPv6 Clients</title>
<section>
<title>Using radvd</title>
<body>

<p>
Clients behind this router should now be able to connect to the rest
of the net via IPv6. If using radvd, configuring hosts should be as easy
as bringing the interface up. (This is probably already done by your
net.ethX init scripts).
</p>

<pre caption="Connecting through IPv6">
