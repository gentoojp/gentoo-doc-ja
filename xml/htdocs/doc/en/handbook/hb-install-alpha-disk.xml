<title>Slices</title>
<body>

<p>
Although it is theoretically possible to use a full disk to house your Linux
system, this is almost never done in practice. Instead, full disk block devices
are split up in smaller, more manageable block devices. On Alpha systems,
these are called <e>slices</e>. 
</p>

<title>Default Partitioning Scheme</title>
<body>

<p>
As an example we use the following slice layout:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Slice</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><path>/dev/sda1</path></ti>
  <ti>Swap slice</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><path>/dev/sda2</path></ti>
  <ti>Root slice</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><path>/dev/sda3</path></ti>
  <ti>Full disk (required)</ti>
</tr>
</table>


<p>
If you are interested in knowing how big a partition should be, or even how 
many partitions (or volumes) you need, read on. Otherwise continue now with
<uri link="#fdisk_SRM">Using fdisk to Partition your Disk (SRM only)</uri> 
or <uri link="#fdisk_ARC">Using fdisk to Partition your Disk (ARC/AlphaBIOS 
only)</uri>.
</p>

</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>How Many and How Big?</title>
<body>

<p>
The number of partitions is highly dependent on your environment. For instance,
if you have lots of users, you will most likely want to have your
<path>/home</path> separate as it increases security and makes backups easier.
If you are installing Gentoo to perform as a mailserver, your 
<path>/var</path> should be separate as all mails are stored inside 
<path>/var</path>. A good choice of filesystem will then maximise your 
performance. Gameservers will have a separate <path>/opt</path> as most gaming 
servers are installed there. The reason is similar for <path>/home</path>: 
security and backups. You will definitely want to keep <path>/usr</path> big:
not only will it contain the majority of applications, the Portage tree alone
takes around 500 Mbyte excluding the various sources that are stored in it.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, it very much depends on what you want to achieve. Separate
partitions or volumes have the following advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  You can choose the best performing filesystem for each partition or volume
</li>
<li>
  Your entire system cannot run out of free space if one defunct tool is
  continuously writing files to a partition or volume
</li>
<li>
  If necessary, file system checks are reduced in time, as multiple checks can
  be done in parallel (although this advantage is more with multiple disks than
  it is with multiple partitions)
</li>
<li>
  Security can be enhanced by mounting some partitions or volumes read-only, 
  nosuid (setuid bits are ignored), noexec (executable bits are ignored) etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, multiple partitions have disadvantages as well. If not configured
properly, you will have a system with lots of free space on one partition and
none on another. Another nuisance is that separate partitions - especially
for important mountpoints like <path>/usr</path> or <path>/var</path> - often
require the administrator to boot with an initramfs to mount the partition
before other boot scripts start. This isn't always the case though, so your
results may vary.

The following parts explain how to create the example slice layout described
previously, namely:

<title>Identifying Available Disks</title>
<body>

<p>
To figure out what disks you have running, use the following commands:
</p>

<pre caption="Identifying available disks">
# <i>dmesg | grep 'drive$'</i>        <comment>(For IDE disks)</comment>
# <i>dmesg | grep 'scsi'</i>          <comment>(For SCSI disks)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
From this output you should be able to see what disks were detected and their
respective <path>/dev</path> entry. In the following parts we assume that the
disk is a SCSI disk on <path>/dev/sda</path>.
</p>

<p>
Now fire up <c>fdisk</c>:

<title>Deleting All Slices</title>
<body>

<p>
If your hard drive is completely blank, then you'll have to first create 
a BSD disklabel.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a BSD disklabel">

/dev/sda contains no disklabel.

<p>
We start with deleting all slices <e>except</e> the 'c'-slice (a requirement 
for using BSD disklabels).  The following shows how to delete a slice (in 
the example we use 'a').  Repeat the process to delete all other slices 
(again, except the 'c'-slice).
</p>

<p>
Use <c>p</c> to view all existing slices. <c>d</c> is used to delete a slice.

After repeating this process for all slices, a listing should show you something
similar to this:

<title>Creating the Swap Slice</title>
<body>

<p>
On Alpha based systems you don't need a separate boot slice. However, the
first cylinder cannot be used as the <c>aboot</c> image will be placed there.
</p>

<p>
We will create a swap slice starting at the third cylinder, with a total
size of 1 GB. Use <c>n</c> to create a new slice. After creating the slice,
we will change its type to <c>1</c> (one), meaning <e>swap</e>.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the swap slice">
BSD disklabel command (m for help): <i>n</i>
Partition (a-p): <i>a</i>
First cylinder (1-5290, default 1): <i>3</i>
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (3-5290, default 5290): <i>+1024M</i>

BSD disklabel command (m for help): <i>t</i>
Partition (a-c): <i>a</i>
Hex code (type L to list codes): <i>1</i>
</pre>

<p>
After these steps you should see a layout similar to the following:
</p>

<pre caption="Slice layout after creating the swap slice">
BSD disklabel command (m for help): <i>p</i>

3 partitions:
#       start       end      size     fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]                                    
  a:        3      1003      1001       swap
  c:        1      5290*     5289*    unused        0     0
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Create the Root Slice</title>
<body>

<p>
We will now create the root slice, starting from the first cylinder <e>after</e>
the swap slice. Use the <c>p</c> command to view where the swap slice ends. In
our example, this is at 1003, making the root slice start at 1004.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is that there is currently a bug in <c>fdisk</c> making it think
the number of available cylinders is one above the real number of cylinders. In
other words, when you are asked for the last cylinder, decrease the cylinder
number (in this example: 5290) with one.
</p>

<p>
When the slice is created, we change the type to <c>8</c>, for <e>ext2</e>.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating the root slice">

<title>Applying a Filesystem to a Partition</title>

<p>
To create a filesystem on a partition or volume, there are tools available for 
each possible filesystem:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Filesystem</th>
  <th>Creation Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ext2</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.ext2</c></ti>

<tr>
  <ti>jfs</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.jfs</c></ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
For instance, to have the root partition (<path>/dev/sda2</path> in our example)
in ext4, you would use:
</p>

<pre caption="Applying a filesystem on a partition">
# <i>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2</i>

<p>
Now create the filesystems on your newly created partitions (or logical
volumes).

<title>Activating the Swap Partition</title>

<p>
<c>mkswap</c> is the command that is used to initialize swap partitions:
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a Swap signature">
# <i>mkswap /dev/sda1</i>
</pre>

<p>
To activate the swap partition, use <c>swapon</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Activating the swap partition">

<p>
Create and activate the swap with the commands mentioned above.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
</section>
<section>
<title>Mounting</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your partitions are initialized and are housing a filesystem, it is
time to mount those partitions. Use the <c>mount</c> command. Don't forget to
create the necessary mount directories for every partition you created. As an
example we mount the root partition:
</p>

<pre caption="Mounting partitions">
# <i>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/gentoo</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you want your <path>/tmp</path> to reside on a separate partition, be sure to
change its permissions after mounting: <c>chmod 1777 /mnt/gentoo/tmp</c>. This
also holds for <path>/var/tmp</path>.
</note>

<p>
We will also have to mount the proc filesystem (a virtual interface with the 
kernel) on <path>/proc</path>. But first we will need to place our files on the partitions.
