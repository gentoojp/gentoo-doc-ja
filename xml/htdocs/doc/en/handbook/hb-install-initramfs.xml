<title>(Optional) Building an Initramfs</title>
<body>

<p>
If you use a specific partition layout where important file system locations
(like <path>/usr</path> or <path>/var</path>) are on separate partitions, then
you will need to setup an initramfs so that this partition can be mounted before
it is needed.
</p>

<p>
Without an initramfs, you risk that the system will not boot up properly as the
tools that are responsible for mounting the file systems need information that
resides on those file systems. An initramfs will pull in the necessary files
into an archive which is used right after the kernel boots, but before the
control is handed over to the <c>init</c> tool. Scripts on the initramfs will
then make sure that the partitions are properly mounted before the system
continues booting.
</p>

<p>
To install an initramfs, install <c>genkernel</c> first, then have it 
generate an initramfs for you.
</p>

<pre caption="Building an initramfs">
# <i>emerge genkernel</i>
# <i>genkernel --install initramfs</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you need specific support in the initramfs, such as lvm or raid, add in the
appropriate options to genkernel. See <c>genkernel --help</c> for more
information, or the next example which enables support for LVM and software raid
(mdadm):
</p>

<pre caption="Building an initramfs with support for LVM and software raid">
# <i>genkernel --lvm --mdadm --install initramfs</i>
</pre>

<p>
The initramfs will be stored in <path>/boot</path>. You can find the file by
simply listing the files starting with <path>initramfs</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking the initramfs file name">
# <i>ls /boot/initramfs*</i>
</pre>

Now continue with <uri link="#kernel_modules">Kernel Modules</uri>.
