<title>The Gentoo Installation CDs</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo Installation CDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All Installation CDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet.
</p>
<!--
<impo>
If you wish to install Gentoo without a working Internet connection, please use
the installation instructions described in the <uri
link="2008.0/index.xml">Gentoo 2008.0 Handbooks</uri>.
</impo>
-->
<!--
<p>
The two Installation CDs that we currently provide are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Minimal</e> Installation CD, a small, no-nonsense, bootable CD
    which sole purpose is to boot the system, prepare the networking and 
    continue with the Gentoo installation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Universal</e> Installation CD, a bootable CD with the same 
    abilities as the Minimal Installation CD. Additionally, it contains 
    several stage3 tarballs (optimized for the individual subarchitectures). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To help you decide which Installation CD you need, we have written down the
major advantages and disadvantages of each Installation CD.
</p>
-->
</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Minimal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Minimal Installation CD is called <c><keyval id="min-cd-name"/></c> and
takes up around <keyval id="min-cd-size"/> MB of diskspace. You can use this
Installation CD to install Gentoo, but <e>only</e> with a working Internet
connection.
</p>

  <th>-</th>

    Contains no stage3 tarball, no Portage snapshot, no prebuilt packages and is

  </ti>

</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Universal Installation CD is called
<c>install-sparc64-universal-2008.0.iso</c> and uses 295 MB. You can use this
Installation CD to install Gentoo, and you can even use it to install Gentoo
without a working internet connection.
</p>

<table>

  <th>Universal Installation CD</th>

<subsection>
<title>Other CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You might find a <e>Package CD</e> on one of our mirrors. This CD is not an
Installation CD but an additional resource that can be exploited during a
networkless installation. It contains prebuilt packages (also known as the GRP
set) that allow you to easily and quickly install additional applications
(such as OpenOffice.org, KDE, GNOME, ...) immediately after the networkless
Gentoo installation.
</p>

<p>
If you intend to use the Packages CD to quickly install additional software,
make sure that you use the same subarchitecture as the stage3 tarball you use.
</p>
-->
</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>The Stage3 Tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
A stage3 tarball is an archive containing a minimal Gentoo environment, suitable
to continue the Gentoo installation using the instructions in this manual.
Previously, the Gentoo Handbook described the installation using one of three 
stage tarballs. While Gentoo still offers stage1 and stage2 tarballs, the 
official installation method uses the stage3 tarball. If you are interested in
performing a Gentoo installation using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, please read
the Gentoo FAQ on <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">How do I Install Gentoo
Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?</uri>
</p>

<p>
Stage3 tarballs can be downloaded from <path><keyval
id="release-dir"/>current-stage3/</path> on any of the <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">Official Gentoo Mirrors</uri> and are not provided
on the LiveCD.
</p>

<title>TFTPBoot image</title>
<body>

<p>
If you can't use a CD, or prefer booting over an IP network, there're also
TFTPBoot images available on our <uri link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>
under <path>experimental/sparc/tftpboot/sparc64/</path>.

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo Installation CD. We'll first start by 
downloading and burning the chosen Installation CD. We previously discussed 
the several available Installation CDs, but where can you find them?
</p>

<p>
You can download any of the Installation CDs from one of our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located in
the <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>current-iso/</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find ISO files. Those are full CD images which you
can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can check
its SHA-2 checksum and compare it with the SHA-2 checksum we provide (such as
<path><keyval id="min-cd-name"/>.DIGESTS</path>). You can check the SHA-2
checksum with the <c>sha512sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.krylack.com/file-checksum-tool/">File Checksum Tool</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying the SHA-2 checksum">
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS&gt;</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you get the message that no properly formatted SHA checksum was found, take a
look at the DIGESTS file yourself to see what the supported checksums are.
</note>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public keys whose
key ids can be found on the <uri link="/proj/en/releng/index.xml">release
engineering project site</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
<comment>(... Substitute the key ids with those mentioned on the release engineering site ...)</comment>
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 96D8BF6D 2D182910 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the files">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device 
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>Burn CD Image</c>. Then you can locate
    your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Booting the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
Insert the Gentoo Installation CD in the CD-ROM and boot your system. During 
startup, press Stop-A to enter OpenBootPROM (OBP). Once you are in the OBP, 
boot from the CD-ROM:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting the Installation CD">
ok <i>boot cdrom</i>
</pre>

<p>
You will be greeted by the SILO boot manager (on the Installation CD). You can
hit Enter for more help if you want. Type in <c>gentoo</c> and press enter to
continue booting the system:
</p>

<pre caption="Continue booting from the Installation CD">
boot: <i>gentoo</i>
</pre>

<p>
Once the Installation CD is booted, you will be automatically logged onÂ to the
system.
</p>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console. You will also find a
root prompt on the serial console (<path>ttyS0</path>).
</p>

<p>
Continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware Configuration</uri>.
