<title>Hardware Requirements</title>
<body>

<p>
Pretty much every IA64 should be able to boot Gentoo.  At the moment we only
have LiveCDs, so your machine must have a CDROM drive installed.

<title>The Gentoo Installation CDs</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo Installation CDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All Installation CDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet.
</p>
<!--
<impo>
If you wish to install Gentoo without a working Internet connection, or would
like to use one of the provided installers, please use the installation
instructions described in the <uri link="2008.0/">Gentoo 2008.0
Handbooks</uri>.
</impo>

<p>
The Installation CD that we currently provide for IA64:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Minimal</e> Installation CD, a small, no-nonsense, bootable 
    CD which sole purpose is to boot the system, prepare the networking and 
    continue with the Gentoo installation.
  </li>
</ul>
-->
</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Minimal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Minimal Installation CD is called <c><keyval id="min-cd-name"/></c> and
takes up around <keyval id="min-cd-size"/> MB of diskspace. You can use this
Installation CD to install Gentoo, but <e>only</e> with a working Internet
connection.

<subsection>
<title>The Stage3 Tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
A stage3 tarball is an archive containing a minimal Gentoo environment,
suitable to continue the Gentoo installation using the instructions in this
manual. Previously, the Gentoo Handbook described the installation using one of
three stage tarballs. While Gentoo still offers stage1 and stage2 tarballs, the
official installation method uses the stage3 tarball. If you are interested in
performing a Gentoo installation using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, please read
the Gentoo FAQ on <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">How do I Install Gentoo
Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?</uri>
</p>

<p>
Stage3 tarballs can be downloaded from <path><keyval
id="release-dir"/>current-stage3/</path> on any of the <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">Official Gentoo Mirrors</uri> and are not provided
on the LiveCD.

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo Installation CD. We'll first start by 
downloading and burning the chosen Installation CD. We previously discussed 
the several available Installation CDs, but where can you find them? 
</p>

<p>
You can download any of the Installation CDs from one of our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located in
the <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>current-iso/</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find ISO files. Those are full CD images which you
can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can check
its SHA-2 checksum and compare it with the SHA-2 checksum we provide (such as
<path><keyval id="min-cd-name"/>.DIGESTS</path>). You can check the SHA-2 
checksum with the <c>sha512sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.sinf.gr/en/hashcalc.html">Checksums calculator</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying the SHA-2 checksum">
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS&gt;</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you get the message that no properly formatted SHA checksum was found, take a
look at the DIGESTS file yourself to see what the supported checksums are.
</note>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public keys whose
key ids can be found on the <uri link="/proj/en/releng/index.xml">release
engineering project site</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
<comment>(... Substitute the key ids with those mentioned on the release engineering site ...)</comment>
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 96D8BF6D 2D182910 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the files">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 &lt;downloaded iso 
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/sr0</path> with your CD-RW drive's 
    device path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>Burn CD Image</c>. Then you can locate
    your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<subsection>
<title>Booting the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
Once you have burnt your installation CD, it is time to boot it.
Remove all CDs from your CD drives, and insert the Gentoo
InstallCD. Reboot your system and wait for the EFI firmware to load on
the console. The exact option to select will differ depending on your
hardware.
</p>

<p>
Most implementations usually present an option directly on the first
menu (the EFI Boot Manager). The exact wording would differ but would
usually be something like &quot;CD Boot&quot;, &quot;Removable Media
Boot&quot; or &quot;Internal Bootable DVD&quot;. Select this option.
</p>

<p>
If your EFI implementation does not present such an option, you can
boot the CD using the EFI Shell. All implementations will present an
option to enter the shell on the Boot Manager menu. Select this
option. The EFI Shell will display a list of usable block devices
(<c>blk<b>n</b>:</c>) and also a list of filesystems the EFI Shell
can actually access (<c>fs<b>n</b>:</c>).
</p>

<p>
In most cases the option you want will be the <c>fs0:</c> choice;
regardless, (provided the CD drive recognizes the CD), you should
see one <c>fs<b>n</b></c> entry for your CD drive (the CD drive's
EFI device path will contain <c>CDROM</c> in the wording). Enter
<c>fs<b>n</b>:</c>, replacing <b>n</b> as required and including
the colon, followed by the Enter key. Next just type <c>elilo</c>
followed by the Enter key.
</p>

<p>
You will now be greeted by the ELILO boot message and asked to
enter a kernel to boot as well as any additional options to pass
to the kernel command line. In most cases just hit the Enter key
or wait five seconds. Only one kernel is supplied on the IA64
InstallCD, the <c>gentoo</c> kernel.
</p>

<p>
Several kernel aliases are provided which add extra options to
the kernel command line, which you may have to use instead of
the default <c>gentoo</c> option depending on your hardware:
</p>

<p>
The <c>gentoo-serial</c> option forces a serial console on the first
serial port (ttyS0) at 9600bps. This may be required on some older EFI
implementations where the kernel can't detect what console to use. You
should try this option if booting the default <c>gentoo</c> kernel
produces no output and if you are using a serial console. If you use a
serial console which is not connected to the first serial port you
must manually select the console by typing <c>gentoo
console=ttyS#,9600</c> where <c>#</c> is the number of the serial
port.
</p>

<p>
The <c>gentoo-ilo</c> option forces a serial console on the <c>ttyS3</c> serial
port at 9600bps. This should be used if you're installing using the HP iLO
remote console feature.
</p>

<p>
The <c>gentoo-sgi</c> option forces a serial console on the <c>ttySG0</c>
serial port at 115200bps. This should only be needed on SGI hardware, and
if the console is properly selected in the default EFI settings, or if you
are using a video console this option should not be required.
</p>

</body>
<body>

<p>
You can also provide kernel options. They represent optional settings
you can (de)activate at will.
</p>

</body>

<body>
<include href="hb-install-kernelparams.xml"/>
</body>

<body>

<note>
The CD will check for "no*" options before "do*" options, so that you can
override any option in the exact order you specify.
</note>

<p>
You will then be greeted with a boot screen. If you are installing Gentoo on a
system with a non-US keyboard, make sure you select the layout at the prompt. If
no selection is made in 10 seconds the default (US keyboard) will be accepted
and the boot process will continue. Once the boot process completes, you will be
automatically logged in to the "Live" Gentoo Linux as "root", the super user.
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console. If you are using a
video console and have a keyboard connected you can also switch to other
consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you started
on by pressing Alt-F1.
