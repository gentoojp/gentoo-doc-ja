<title>Partitions and Slices</title>
<body>

<p>
Although it is theoretically possible to use a full disk to house your Linux
system, this is almost never done in practice. Instead, full disk block devices
are split up in smaller, more manageable block devices. On most systems, these
are called <e>partitions</e>. Other architectures use a similar technique,
called <e>slices</e>.

<title>Designing a Partitioning Scheme</title>
<subsection>
<title>How Many and How Big?</title>
<body>

<p>
The number of partitions is highly dependent on your environment. For instance,
if you have lots of users, you will most likely want to have your
<path>/home</path> separate as it increases security and makes backups easier.
If you are installing Gentoo to perform as a mailserver, your <path>/var</path>
should be separate as all mails are stored inside <path>/var</path>. A good
choice of filesystem will then maximise your performance. Gameservers will have
a separate <path>/opt</path> as most gaming servers are installed there. The
reason is similar for <path>/home</path>: security and backups. You will
definitely want to keep <path>/usr</path> big: not only will it contain the
majority of applications, the Portage tree alone takes around 500 Mbyte
excluding the various sources that are stored in it.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, it very much depends on what you want to achieve. Separate
partitions or volumes have the following advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  You can choose the best performing filesystem for each partition or volume
</li>
<li>
  Your entire system cannot run out of free space if one defunct tool is
  continuously writing files to a partition or volume
</li>
<li>
  If necessary, file system checks are reduced in time, as multiple checks can
  be done in parallel (although this advantage is more with multiple disks than
  it is with multiple partitions)
</li>
<li>
  Security can be enhanced by mounting some partitions or volumes read-only, 
  nosuid (setuid bits are ignored), noexec (executable bits are ignored) etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, multiple partitions have disadvantages as well. If not configured
properly, you will have a system with lots of free space on one partition and
none on another. Another nuisance is that separate partitions - especially
for important mountpoints like <path>/usr</path> or <path>/var</path> - often
require the administrator to boot with an initramfs to mount the partition
before other boot scripts start. This isn't always the case though, so your
results may vary.
</p>

<p>
There is also a 15-partition limit for SCSI and SATA.

<title>Using fdisk on HPPA to Partition your Disk</title>
<body>

<p>
Use <c>fdisk</c> to create the partitions you want:
</p>

<pre caption="Partitioning the disk">
# <i>fdisk /dev/sda</i>
</pre>

<p>
HPPA machines use the PC standard DOS partition tables.  To create a new 
DOS partition table, simply use the <c>o</c> command.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a DOS partition table">
# <i>fdisk /dev/sda</i>

Command (m for help): <i>o</i>
Building a new DOS disklabel.
</pre>

<p>
PALO (the HPPA bootloader) needs a special partition to work.  You have 
to create a partition of at least 16MB at the beginning of your disk.  
The partition type must be of type <e>f0</e> (Linux/PA-RISC boot).
</p>

<impo>
If you ignore this and continue without a special PALO partition, your system
will stop loving you and fail to start. Also, if your disk is larger than 2GB,
make sure that the boot partition is in the first 2GB of your disk. PALO is
unable to read a kernel after the 2GB limit.
</impo>

<pre caption="A simple default partition scheme">
# <i>cat /etc/fstab</i>
/dev/sda2    /boot   ext3    noauto,noatime   1 1
/dev/sda3    none    swap    sw               0 0
/dev/sda4    /       ext3    noatime          0 0

# <i>fdisk /dev/sda</i>

Command (m for help): <i>p</i>

Disk /dev/sda: 4294 MB, 4294816768 bytes
133 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1017 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 8246 * 512 = 4221952 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1               1           8       32953   f0  Linux/PA-RISC boot
/dev/sda2               9          20       49476   83  Linux
/dev/sda3              21          70      206150   82  Linux swap
/dev/sda4              71        1017     3904481   83  Linux

<p>
Now that your partitions are created, it is time to place a filesystem on them. 
If you don't care about what filesystem to choose and are happy with what we use
as default in this handbook, continue with <uri 
link="#filesystems-apply">Applying a Filesystem to a Partition</uri>.
Otherwise read on to learn about the available filesystems...

<title>Applying a Filesystem to a Partition</title>
<body>

<p>
To create a filesystem on a partition or volume, there are tools available for 
each possible filesystem:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Filesystem</th>
  <th>Creation Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ext2</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.ext2</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ext3</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.ext3</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>ext4</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.ext4</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>reiserfs</ti>
  <ti><c>mkreiserfs</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>xfs</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.xfs</c></ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti>jfs</ti>
  <ti><c>mkfs.jfs</c></ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
For instance, to have the boot partition (<path>/dev/sda2</path> in our
example) in ext2 and the root partition (<path>/dev/sda4</path> in our example)
in ext3 (as in our example), you would use:
</p>

<pre caption="Applying a filesystem on a partition">
# <i>mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda2</i>
# <i>mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda4</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now create the filesystems on your newly created partitions (or logical
volumes).
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Activating the Swap Partition</title>
<body>

<p>
<c>mkswap</c> is the command that is used to initialize swap partitions:
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a Swap signature">
# <i>mkswap /dev/sda3</i>
</pre>

<p>
To activate the swap partition, use <c>swapon</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Activating the swap partition">
# <i>swapon /dev/sda3</i>
</pre>

<p>
Create and activate the swap with the commands mentioned above.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
</section>
<section>
<title>Mounting</title>
<body>

<p>
Now that your partitions are initialized and are housing a filesystem, it is
time to mount those partitions. Use the <c>mount</c> command. Don't forget to
create the necessary mount directories for every partition you created. As an
example we mount the root and boot partition:
</p>

<pre caption="Mounting partitions">
# <i>mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/gentoo</i>
# <i>mkdir /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
# <i>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/gentoo/boot</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you want your <path>/tmp</path> to reside on a separate partition, be sure
to change its permissions after mounting: <c>chmod 1777 /mnt/gentoo/tmp</c>.
This also holds for <path>/var/tmp</path>.
</note>

<p>
We will also have to mount the proc filesystem (a virtual interface with the
kernel) on <path>/proc</path>. But first we will need to place our files on the
partitions.
</p>

<p>
Continue with <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=5">Installing the Gentoo
Installation Files</uri>.
