<title>The Gentoo Installation CDs</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo Installation CDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All Installation CDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet.
</p>

<!--
<impo>
If you wish to install Gentoo without a working Internet connection, please use
the installation instructions described in the <uri
link="2008.0/index.xml">Gentoo 2008.0 Handbooks</uri>.
</impo>
-->
<!--
<p>
The two Installation CDs that we currently provide are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Minimal</e> Installation CD, a small, no-nonsense, bootable 
    CD which sole purpose is to boot the system, prepare the networking and 
    continue with the Gentoo installation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Gentoo <e>Universal</e> Installation CD, a bootable CD with the same 
    abilities as the Minimal Installation CD. Additionally, it contains 
    several stage3 tarballs (optimized for the individual subarchitectures). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To help you decide which Installation CD you need, we have written down the 
major advantages and disadvantages of each Installation CD.
</p>
-->
</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Minimal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Minimal Installation CD is called <c><keyval id="min-cd-name"/></c> and
takes up around <keyval id="min-cd-size"/> MB of diskspace. You can use this
Installation CD to install Gentoo, but <e>only</e> with a working Internet
connection.
</p>
<!--

  <th>-</th>
  <ti>
    Contains no stage3 tarball, no Portage snapshot, no prebuilt packages and is
    therefore not suitable for networkless installation
  </ti>

</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo's Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Universal Installation CD is called <c>install-hppa-universal-2008.0.iso</c>
and consumes about 339 MB on a CD. You can use this Installation CD to install
Gentoo, and you can even use it to install Gentoo without a working internet
connection.
</p>

</table>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Other CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You might find a <e>Package CD</e> on one of our mirrors. This CD is not an
Installation CD but an additional resource that can be exploited during a
networkless installation. It contains prebuilt packages (also known as the GRP
set) that allow you to easily and quickly install additional applications (such
as OpenOffice.org, KDE, GNOME, ...) immediately after the networkless Gentoo
installation.
</p>

<p>
If you intend to use the Packages CD to quickly install additional software,
make sure that you use the same subarchitecture as the stage3 tarball you use.
</p>
-->
</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>The Stage3 Tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
A stage3 tarball is an archive containing a minimal Gentoo environment, suitable
to continue the Gentoo installation using the instructions in this manual.
Previously, the Gentoo Handbook described the installation using one of three 
stage tarballs. While Gentoo still offers stage1 and stage2 tarballs, the 
official installation method uses the stage3 tarball. If you are interested in
performing a Gentoo installation using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, please read
the Gentoo FAQ on <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">How do I Install Gentoo
Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?</uri>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo Installation CD. We'll first start by 
downloading and burning the chosen Installation CD. We previously discussed 
the several available Installation CDs, but where can you find them? 
</p>
<!-- note: replace release path with:
    <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>current-iso/</path>
as soon as autobuild CDs are available for HPPA -->
<p>
You can download any of the Installation CDs from one of our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located in
the <path>releases/hppa/2008.0/installcd/</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find ISO files. Those are full CD images which you
can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can check
its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we provide (such as
<path><keyval id="min-cd-name"/>.DIGESTS</path>). You can check the MD5
checksum with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public keys whose
key ids can be found on the <uri link="/proj/en/releng/index.xml">release
engineering project site</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
<comment>(... Substitute the key ids with those mentioned on the release engineering site ...)</comment>
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 96D8BF6D 2D182910 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the files">
<comment>(Verify the cryptographic signature)</comment>
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
<comment>(Verify the checksum)</comment>
$ <i>sha1sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>Burn CD Image</c>. Then you can locate
    your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Booting the Installation CD</title>
<body>

<note>
If you have problems booting the Installation CD or any other media, please 
read the <uri 
link="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PA-RISC-Linux-Boot-HOWTO/index.html">
PA-RISC Linux Boot HOWTO</uri>.
</note>

<p>
Boot your HPPA system. During the boot process, you will see a message similar
to the following:
</p>

<pre caption="HPPA boot message">
Searching for Potential Boot Devices.
To terminate search, press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>

<p>
When this message appears, press and hold the Esc-key until an option menu
appears. This can take a while, be patient. By default, you should enter the
BOOT_ADMIN console. If you receive an option menu, choose <c>Enter Boot
Administration mode</c> to enter the BOOT_ADMIN console. You should now have an
'&gt;' prompt.
</p>

<p>
Put the Gentoo Installation CD in the CD-ROM. If you do not know the SCSI ID of 
your CD-ROM drive, your PA-RISC station will search for it when you issue the 
<c>search</c> command.
</p>

<pre caption="Searching for SCSI ID">
&gt; <i>search</i>
Searching for Devices with Bootable Media.
To terminate search, please press and hold the ESCAPE key.
</pre>

<p>
Your PA-RISC station will now display all the available boot media. This is an
example result of this command:
</p>

<pre caption="Available boot media">

</pre>

<p>
To boot from a CD-ROM you need the accompanying Device Path. For instance, if we
want to boot from the TOSHIBA CD-ROM in the above example, we would need to type
the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Booting from a CD-ROM">
&gt; <i>boot scsi.5.0 ipl</i>

Trying scsi.5.0
</pre>

<p>
The <c>ipl</c> keyword (Initial Program Loader) tells palo (the PA-RISC boot
LOader) to enter interactive mode. This will allow you to change, for example,
the kernel boot parameters.
</p>

<p>
When the boot is successful, palo will start in interactive mode:
</p>

<pre caption="PALO Interactive Mode">
Boot path initialized.
Attempting to load IPL.


HARD Booted.
palo ipl 1.5 root@hope Sat Apr 23 18:06:47 CEST 2005

Boot image contains:

    0/vmlinux64 8352719 bytes @ 0x3ef8000
    0/ramdisk 1007589 bytes @ 0x105800

Information: No console specified on kernel command line. This is normal.
PALO will choose the console currently used by firmware (serial).Current command line:
0/vmlinux initrd=initrd TERM=linux root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc cdroot looptype=squashfs loop=/livecd.squashfs hda=scsi console=ttyS0
 0: 0/vmlinux
 1: initrd=initrd
 2: TERM=linux
 3: root=/dev/ram0
 4: init=/linuxrc
 5: cdroot
 6: looptype=squashfs
 7: loop=/livecd.squashfs
 8: hda=scsi
 9: console=ttyS0

&lt;#&gt;    edit the numbered field
'b'    boot with this command line
'r'    restore command line
'l'    list dir
</pre>

<p>
These parameters are suitable for most situations.
</p>

<p>
If you need extra features you must add the appropriate keyword(s) to the end of
the command line. To add a keyword, edit the last field, add a space and type 
your keyword. The only implemented keywords as of now are <c>cdcache</c> which 
tells the Installation CD to load itself into RAM, allowing you to unmount the
CD, and <c>noload=module1[,module2[,...]]</c> which allows you to explicitly 
disable loading of particular modules.
</p>

<pre caption="Adding hdb=scsi as boot option">
(or 'b' to boot with this command line)? <i>9</i>
console=ttyS0 <i>hdb=scsi</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now that you have tweaked your kernel boot params, boot it.
</p>

<pre caption="Booting the kernel">
(or 'b' to boot with this command line)? <i>b</i>
</pre>

<p>
You should have a root ("#") prompt on the current console and can also switch
to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get back to the one you
started on by pressing Alt-F1.
