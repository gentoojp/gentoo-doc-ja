<title>The Gentoo Installation CDs</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
The <e>Gentoo Installation CDs</e> are bootable CDs which contain a
self-sustained Gentoo environment. They allow you to boot Linux from the CD.
During the boot process your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers
are loaded. They are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
All Installation CDs allow you to boot, set up networking, initialize your
partitions and start installing Gentoo from the Internet.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Minimal Installation CD</title>
<body>

<p>
The Minimal Installation CD is called <c><keyval id="min-cd-name"/></c> and
takes up around <keyval id="min-cd-size"/> MB of diskspace. You can use this
Installation CD to install Gentoo, but <e>only</e> with a working Internet
connection.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>The Stage3 Tarball</title>
<body>

<p>
A stage3 tarball is an archive containing a minimal Gentoo environment,
suitable to continue the Gentoo installation using the instructions in this
manual. Previously, the Gentoo Handbook described the installation using one of
three stage tarballs. While Gentoo still offers stage1 and stage2 tarballs, the
official installation method uses the stage3 tarball. If you are interested in
performing a Gentoo installation using a stage1 or stage2 tarball, please read
the Gentoo FAQ on <uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_Install_Gentoo_Using_a_Stage1_or_Stage2_Tarball.3F">How
do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?</uri>
</p>

<p>
Stage3 tarballs can be downloaded from <path><keyval
id="release-dir"/>current-stage3/</path> on any of the <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">Official Gentoo Mirrors</uri> and are not provided
on the LiveCD.

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You have chosen to use a Gentoo Installation CD. We'll first start by
downloading and burning the chosen Installation CD. We previously discussed
the several available Installation CDs, but where can you find them?
</p>

<p>
You can download any of the Installation CDs from one of our <uri
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located in
the <path><keyval id="release-dir"/>current-iso/</path> directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside that directory you'll find ISO files. Those are full CD images which you
can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder if your downloaded file is corrupted or not, you can check
its SHA-2 checksum and compare it with the SHA-2 checksum we provide (such as
<path><keyval id="min-cd-name"/>.DIGESTS</path>). You can check the SHA-2
checksum with the <c>sha512sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or <uri
link="http://www.sinf.gr/en/hashcalc.html">Checksums calculator</uri> for Windows.
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying the SHA-2 checksum">
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS&gt;</i>
</pre>

<note>
If you get the message that no properly formatted SHA checksum was found, take a
look at the DIGESTS file yourself to see what the supported checksums are.
</note>

<p>
Another way to check the validity of the downloaded file is to use GnuPG to
verify the cryptographic signature that we provide (the file ending with
<path>.asc</path>). Download the signature file and obtain the public keys whose
key ids can be found on the <uri link="/proj/en/releng/index.xml">release
engineering project site</uri>.
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
<comment>(... Substitute the key ids with those mentioned on the release engineering site ...)</comment>
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 96D8BF6D 2D182910 17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the files">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
$ <i>sha512sum -c &lt;downloaded iso.DIGESTS.asc&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_burn_an_ISO_file.3F">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/sr0</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>Burn CD Image</c>. Then you can locate
    your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<subsection>
<title>Default: Booting the Installation CD with Yaboot</title>
<body>

<p>
On NewWorld machines place the Installation CD in the CD-ROM and reboot the 
system. When the system-start-bell sounds, simply hold down the 'C' until the
CD loads.
</p>

<p>
After the Installation CD loaded, you will be greeted by a friendly welcome 
message and a <e>boot:</e> prompt at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p>
We provide one generic kernel, <e>ppc32</e>. This kernel is built with support
for multiple CPUs, but it will boot on single processor machines as well.
</p>

<p>
You can tweak some kernel options at this prompt. The following table lists 
some of the available boot options you can add:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Boot Option</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>video</c></ti>
  <ti>
    This option takes one of the following vendor-specific tags:
    <c>nvidiafb</c>, <c>radeonfb</c>, <c>rivafb</c>, <c>atyfb</c>, 
    <c>aty128</c> or <c>ofonly</c>. You can follow this tag with the resolution 
    refresh rate and color depth you want to use. For instance,
    <c>video=radeonfb:1280x1024@75-32</c> will select the ATI Radeon frame buffer
    at a resolution of 1280x1024 with a refresh rate of 75Hz and a color depth of
    32 bits. If you are uncertain what to choose, and the default doesn't work,
    <c>video=ofonly</c> will most certainly work.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>nol3</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Disables level 3 cache on some PowerBooks (needed for at least the 17&quot;)
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>dofirewire</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Enables support for IEEE1394 (FireWire) devices, like external harddisks.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>dopcmcia</c></ti>
  <ti>
    If you want to use PCMCIA devices during your installation (like PCMCIA
    network cards) you have to enable this option.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>dosshd</c></ti>
  <ti>Starts <c>sshd</c>. Useful for unattended installs.</ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>passwd=foo</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Sets whatever is after the = as the root password. Use with <c>dosshd</c>
    for remote installs.
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
To use the above options, at the <e>boot:</e> prompt, type <e>ppc32</e> followed
by the desired option.  In the example below, we'll force the kernel to use the
Open Firmware framebuffer instead of the device specific driver.
</p>

<pre caption="Force the use of the Open Firmware framebuffer">
boot: <i>ppc32 video=ofonly</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you don't need to add any options, just type ppc32 at this prompt, and a 
complete Gentoo Linux environment will be loaded from the CD. Continue with
<uri link="#booted">And When You're Booted...</uri>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Alternative: Booting the Installation CD on a Pegasos</title>
<body>

<p>
On the Pegasos simply insert the CD and at the SmartFirmware boot-prompt type
<c>boot cd /boot/menu</c>. This will open a small bootmenu where you can choose
between several preconfigured video configs. If you need any special boot
options you can append them to the command-line just like with Yaboot above. 
For example: <c>boot cd /boot/pegasos video=radeonfb:1280x1024@75 mem=256M</c>.
The default kernel options (in case something goes wrong and you need it) are 
preconfigured with <c>console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0 init=/linuxrc 
looptype=squashfs loop=/image.squashfs cdroot root=/dev/ram0</c>.
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Alternative: Booting the Installation CD with BootX</title>
<body>

<p>
If you have an OldWorld Mac the bootable portion of the livecd can't be used.
The most simple solution is to use MacOS 9 or earlier to bootstrap into a Linux
environment with a tool called BootX.  
</p>

<p>
First, download <uri link="http://penguinppc.org/bootloaders/bootx/">BootX</uri>
and unpack the archive.  Copy the the <c>BootX Extension</c> from the unpacked
archive into <c>Extensions Folder</c> and the BootX App Control Panel into
<c>Control Panels</c>, both of which are located in your MacOS System Folder.
Next, create a folder called "Linux Kernels" in your System folder and copy the
<c>ppc32</c> kernel from the CD to this folder.  Finally, copy <c>ppc32.igz</c> 
from the Installation CD <path>boot</path> folder into the MacOS 
<c>System Folder</c>.
</p>

<p>
To prepare BootX, start the BootX App Control Panel.  First select the Options
dialog and check <c>Use Specified RAM Disk</c> and select <c>ppc32.igz</c> from
your System Folder.  Continue back to the initial screen and ensure that the
ramdisk size is at least <c>32000</c>.  Finally, set the kernel arguments as
shown below:
</p>

<pre caption="BootX kernel arguments">
cdroot root=/dev/ram0 init=linuxrc loop=image.squashfs looptype=squashfs console=tty0 
</pre>

<note>
The kernel parameters in the yaboot section above are also applicable here. You
can append any of those options to the kernel arguments above.
</note>

<p>
Check once more to make sure the settings are correct and then save the 
configuration.  This saves typing just in case it doesn't boot or something is
missing.  Press the Linux button at the top of the window.  If everything goes
correctly, it should boot into the Installation CD. Continue with 
<uri link="#booted">And When You're Booted...</uri>
</p>

</body>
</subsection>

<subsection id="booted">
<title>And When You're Booted...</title>
<body>

<p>
You will be greeted by a root ("#") prompt on the current console. You can also 
switch to other consoles by pressing Alt-F2, Alt-F3 and Alt-F4. Get 
back to the one you started on by pressing Alt-F1.  Due to the keyboard layout,
you may need to press Alt-fn-Fx on Apple machines.
</p>

<p>
If you are installing Gentoo on a system with a non-US keyboard, use
<c>loadkeys</c> to load the keymap for your keyboard. To list the available
keymaps, execute <c>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Listing available keymaps">
<comment>(PPC uses x86 keymaps on most systems.)</comment>
# <i>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now load the keymap of your choice:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading a keymap">
# <i>loadkeys be-latin1</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware Configuration</uri>.
