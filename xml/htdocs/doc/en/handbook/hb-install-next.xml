<p>
Congratulations! You now have a working Gentoo system. But where to go from
here? What are your options now? What to explore first? Gentoo provides its
users with lots of possibilities, and therefore lots of documented (and less
documented) features.
</p>

<p>
You should definitely take a look at the next part of the Gentoo Handbook
entitled <uri link="?part=2">Working with Gentoo</uri> which explains
how to keep your software up to date, how to install more software, what USE 
flags are, how the Gentoo init system works, etc.
</p>

<p>
We also have an official <uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org">Gentoo
Wiki</uri> where additional, community-provided documentation can be found.
The documentation team also offers a
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Documentation/Overview">Documentation
Overview</uri>.
</p>

<p>
You might want to use our <uri
link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Localization/HOWTO">localization guide</uri> to make your
system feel more at home.
</p>

<p>
We also have a <uri link="/doc/en/security/">Gentoo Security Handbook</uri>
which is worth reading.
