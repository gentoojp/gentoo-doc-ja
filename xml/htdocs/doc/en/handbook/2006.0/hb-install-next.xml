<p>
Congratulations! You now have a working Gentoo system. But where to go from
here? What are your options now? What to explore first? Gentoo provides its
users with lots of possibilities, and therefore lots of documented (and less
documented) features.
</p>

<p>
You should definitely take a look at the next part of the Gentoo Handbook
entitled <uri link="?part=2">Working with Gentoo</uri> which explains
how to keep your software up to date, how to install more software, what USE 
flags are, how the Gentoo Init system works, etc.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in optimizing your system for desktop use, or you want to
learn how to configure your system to be a full working desktop system, consult
our extensive <uri link="/doc/en/index.xml?catid=desktop">Gentoo Desktop
Documentation Resources</uri>. Besides, you might want to use our <uri
link="/doc/en/guide-localization.xml">localization guide</uri> to make your
system feel more at home.
</p>

<p>
We also have a <uri link="/doc/en/security/">Gentoo Security Handbook</uri>
which is worth reading.
</p>

<p>
For a full listing of all our available documentation check out our <uri
link="/doc/en/index.xml">Documentation Resources</uri> page.

<title>Gentoo Changes since 2006.0</title>
<subsection>
<title>Changes?</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo is a fast-moving target. The following sections describe important
changes that affect a Gentoo installation. We only list those that have anything
in common with the installation, not with package changes that did not occur
during the installation.
</p>

<p>
There have been no significant changes since.
