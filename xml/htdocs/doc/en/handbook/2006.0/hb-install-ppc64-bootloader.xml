<p>
Now that your kernel is configured and compiled and the necessary system
configuration files are filled in correctly, it is time to install a
program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Such a
program is called a <e>bootloader</e>.
</p>

<p>
On Linux/PPC64 we have only yaBoot as a bootloader until grub2 is
finished.

<impo>
For a 64bit userland use yaboot-static instead of yaboot, because yaboot won't
compile on 64bit userland systems. For a 32bit userland use yaboot as you
normally would.
</impo>

<p>
There are two ways to configure yaBoot for your system. You can use the
new and improved <c>yabootconfig</c> included with
<path>yaboot-1.3.8-r1</path> and later to automatically set up yaboot. If
for some reason you do not want to run <c>yabootconfig</c> to
automatically set up <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> or you are installing Gentoo
on a G5 (on which <c>yabootconfig</c> does not always work), you can just edit 
the sample file already installed on your system.
</p>

<impo>
If you are installing on a G5 using an online install and have not used the 
G5 optimized stages you must change what profile you are linked to now. If you 
do not you will not get dependencies necessary for yaboot to run on Apple 
equipment. In the command below replace <c>(userland)</c> with your chosen 
userland bit level. If you are installing on a G5 using an offline install 
you have to install these packages by hand.
</impo>

<pre caption = "(ONLINE INSTALL FOR G5 USERS ONLY) Changing your profile">
# <i>rm /etc/make.profile</i>
# <i>ln -sf /usr/portage/profiles/default-linux/ppc/2006.0/ppc64/(userland)/970/pmac /etc/make.profile</i>
</pre>

<impo>
yabootconfig/ybin won't work on IBM. You have to install yaboot another way:
<uri link="#yaboot-ibm">Using yaboot on IBM hardware</uri>
</impo>

<note>
If your root filesystem uses the JFS filesystem, be sure to add <c>ro</c> as a
kernel parameter. JFS must be able to replay its log in read-only mode before it
gets mounted read-write.

<p>
<c>yabootconfig</c> will auto-detect the partitions on your machine and will
set up dual and triple boot combinations with Linux, Mac OS, and Mac OS
X.
</p>

<p>
To use <c>yabootconfig</c>, your drive must have a bootstrap partition, and
<path>/etc/fstab</path> must be configured with your Linux partitions. Both of 
these should have been done already in the steps above. To start, ensure that
you have the latest version of yaboot installed by running <c>emerge --update
yaboot-static</c>. This is necessary as the latest version will be available via
Portage, but it may not have made it into the stage files.
</p>

<p>
Now run <c>yabootconfig</c>. The program will run and it will confirm
the location of the bootstrap partition. Type <c>Y</c> if it is correct. If
not, double check <path>/etc/fstab</path>. yabootconfig will then scan your
system setup, create <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> and run <c>mkofboot</c> for
you. <c>mkofboot</c> is used to format the bootstrap partition, and install 
the yaboot configuration file into it.
</p>

<p>
You might want to verify the contents of <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path>. If 
you make changes to <path>/etc/yaboot.conf</path> (like setting the 
default/boot OS), make sure to rerun <c>ybin -v</c> to apply changes to the 
bootstrap partition.
</p>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#reboot">Rebooting your System</uri>.

<p>
Once <path>yaboot.conf</path> is set up the way you want it, you run
<c>mkofboot -v</c> to install the settings in the bootstrap partition.
<e>Don't forget this!</e> Confirm when <c>mkofboot</c> asks you to create a new
filesystem.
</p>

<p>
If all goes well, and you have the same
options as the sample above, your next reboot will give you a simple,
five-entry boot menu. If you update your yaboot config later on, you'll
just need to run <c>ybin -v</c> to update the bootstrap partition -
<c>mkofboot</c> is for initial setup only.

<title>Using yaboot on IBM hardware</title>
<body>

<p>
On IBM hardware you cannot run yabootconfig or ybin. You must proceed with the 
following steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install yaboot-static</li>
  <li>Run 'dd if=/usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot.chrp of=/dev/sdXX' (fill in XX
  with your disk and partition for the PReP partition; this was in our
  example /dev/sda1)</li>
  <li>Next construct your own yaboot.conf file and place into /etc.
  (Take a look at the config above, look into the man page of
  yaboot.conf or look at the below yaboot.conf example)</li>
  <li>Assuming your boot device in OF is pointing to the harddrive you
  prep boot partition is on then it'll just work, otherwise at IPL time,
  go into the multiboot menu and set the boot device to the one with
  your prep boot partition.</li>
  <li>That's it!</li>
</ul>

<pre caption = "yaboot.conf for IBM hardware">
device=disk:
partition=2
root=/dev/sda2
default=2.6.12-gentoo-r10
timeout=50

image=/boot/kernel-2.6.12-gentoo-r10
      label=Linux
      append="console=ttyS0,9600"
      read-only
</pre>

<p>
For POWER4, POWER5, and blade-based hardware where the PReP disk partition 
and the disk partition that contains your kernel are on the same physical disk,
you can use a simplified yaboot.conf.  The following should be sufficient:
</p>

<pre caption="yaboot.conf for PReP hardware">
default = linux
timeout = 100
image=/boot/kernel-2.6.12-gentoo-r10
      label=linux
      read-only
      root = /dev/sda2
      append="root=/dev/sda2"
</pre>

<p>
To verify that yaboot has been copied to the PReP partition:
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying the yaboot install on PReP">
# <i>dd if=/dev/sda1 count=10 | grep ELF</i>
Binary file (standard input) matches
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
</pre>

<p>
A match signifies that yaboot was installed correctly.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section id="reboot">
<title>Rebooting the System</title>
<subsection>
<body>

<p>
Exit the chrooted environment and unmount all mounted partitions. Then type in 
that one magical command you have been waiting for: <c>reboot</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Exiting the chroot, unmounting all partitions and rebooting">
# <i>exit</i>
~# <i>cd</i>
~# <i>umount /mnt/gentoo/boot /mnt/gentoo/dev /mnt/gentoo/proc /mnt/gentoo</i>
~# <i>reboot</i>
</pre>

<p>
Of course, don't forget to remove the bootable CD, otherwise the CD will be
booted again instead of your new Gentoo system.
</p>

<p>
Once rebooted in your Gentoo installation, finish up with <uri
link="?part=1&amp;chap=11">Finalizing your Gentoo Installation</uri>.
