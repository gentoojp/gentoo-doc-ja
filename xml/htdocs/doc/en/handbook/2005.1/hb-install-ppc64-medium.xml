<title>The Gentoo Universal Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Gentoo Linux can be installed using a <e>stage3</e> tarball file.
Such a tarball is an archive that contains a minimal environment from
which you can successfully install Gentoo Linux onto your system.
</p>

<p>
Installations using a stage1 or stage2 tarball file are not documented in the
Gentoo Handbook - please read the <uri link="/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12">Gentoo
FAQ</uri> on these matters.
</p>

</body>

<subsection>
<title>Gentoo Universal Installation CD</title>
<body>
  
<p> 
An Installation CD is a bootable medium which contains a self-sustained Gentoo
environment. It allows you to boot Linux from the CD. During the boot process
your hardware is detected and the appropriate drivers are loaded. The Gentoo
Installation CDs are maintained by Gentoo developers.
</p>

<p>
There currently are two Installation CDs available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Universal Installation CD contains everything you need to install
    Gentoo. It provides stage3 files for common architectures, source code
    for the extra applications you need to choose from and, of course, the
    installation instructions for your architecture.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Minimal Installation CD contains only a minimal environment that allows
    you to boot up and configure your network so you can connect to the
    Internet. It does not contain any additional files and cannot be used
    during the current installation approach.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Gentoo also provides a Package CD. This is not an Installation CD but an
additional resource that you can exploit during the installation of your Gentoo
system. It contains prebuilt packages (also known as the GRP set) that allow
you to easily and quickly install additional applications immediately after the
Gentoo installation and right before you update your Portage tree.
</p>

<p>
The use of the Package CD is covered later in this document.
</p>

<title>Download, Burn and Boot a Gentoo Installation CD</title>
<subsection>
<title>Downloading and Burning the Installation CDs</title>
<body>

<p>
You can download the Universal Installation CD (and, if you want to, the
Packages CD as well) from one of our <uri 
link="/main/en/mirrors.xml">mirrors</uri>. The Installation CDs are located 
in the <path>releases/ppc64/2005.1-r1/installcd</path> directory; 
the Package CDs are located in the <path>releases/ppc64/2005.1/packagecd</path>
directory.
</p>

<p>
Inside those directories you'll find ISO-files. Those are full CD images which
you can write on a CD-R.
</p>

<p>
After downloading the file, you can verify its integrity to see if it is
corrupted or not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can check its MD5 checksum and compare it with the MD5 checksum we
    provide (for instance with the <c>md5sum</c> tool under Linux/Unix or
    <uri link="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum</uri> for Windows).  How
    to verify MD5 checksums with Mac OS X is described in the <uri
    link="/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-faq.xml#doc_chap1">Gentoo PPC FAQ</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can verify the cryptographic signature that we provide. You need to
    obtain the public key we use (0x17072058) before you proceed though.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To fetch our public key using the GnuPG application, run the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Obtaining the public key">
$ <i>gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x17072058</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now verify the signature:
</p>

<pre caption="Verify the cryptographic signature">
$ <i>gpg --verify &lt;signature file&gt; &lt;downloaded iso&gt;</i>
</pre>
    
<p> 
To burn the downloaded ISO(s), you have to select raw-burning. How you
do this is highly program-dependent. We will discuss <c>cdrecord</c> and
<c>K3B</c> here; more information can be found in our <uri
link="/doc/en/faq.xml#isoburning">Gentoo FAQ</uri>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With cdrecord, you simply type <c>cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc &lt;downloaded iso
    file&gt;</c> (replace <path>/dev/hdc</path> with your CD-RW drive's device
    path).
  </li>
  <li>
    With K3B, select <c>Tools</c> &gt; <c>CD</c> &gt; <c>Burn Image</c>. Then
    you can locate your ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Finally click
    <c>Start</c>.
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Booting the Installation CD on an Apple</title>
<body>

<p>
Place the Installation CD in the CD-ROM and reboot the system. Hold down the 
'C' key at bootup. You will be greeted by a friendly welcome message and a 
<e>boot:</e> prompt at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p>
You are also able to tweak some kernel options at this prompt. The following
table lists the available boot options you can add:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Boot Option</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>video</c></ti>
  <ti>
    This option takes one of the following vendor-specific tags:
    <c>radeonfb</c>, <c>rivafb</c>, <c>atyfb</c>, <c>aty128</c> or
    <c>ofonly</c>. You can follow this tag with the resolution and refreshrate
    you want to use. For instance <c>video=radeonfb:1280x1024@75</c>. If you are
    uncertain what to choose, <c>ofonly</c> will most certainly work.
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>nol3</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Disables level 3 cache on some powerbooks (needed for at least the 17'')
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>debug</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Enables verbose booting, spawns an initrd shell that can be used to debug
    the Installation CD
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>sleep=X</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Wait X seconds before continuing; this can be needed by some very old SCSI
    CD-ROMs which don't speed up the CD quick enough
  </ti>
</tr>
<tr>
  <ti><c>bootfrom=X</c></ti>
  <ti>
    Boot from a different device
  </ti>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
At this prompt, hit enter, and a complete Gentoo Linux environment will be
loaded from the CD. Continue with <uri link="#booted">And When You're
Booted...</uri>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Booting the Installation CD on an IBM pSeries</title>
<body>

<p>
For pSeries boxes, sometimes the cds might not autoboot. You might have
to set up your cdrom as a bootable device in the multi-boot menu. (F1 at
startup) The other option is to jump into OF and do it from there:
</p>

<p>
1) Boot into OF  (this is 8 from the serial cons or F8 from a graphics
cons, start hitting the key when you see the keyboard mouse etc etc
messages
</p>
<p>
2) run the command 0> boot cdrom:1,yaboot
</p>
<p>
3) stand back and enjoy!
</p>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="booted">
<title>And When You're Booted...</title>
<body>

<p>
You will be greeted by a root ("#") prompt on the current console. You can also 
switch to other consoles by pressing Alt-fn-F2, Alt-fn-F3 and Alt-fn-F4. Get 
back to the one you started on by pressing Alt-fn-F1.
</p>

<p>
If you are installing Gentoo on a system with a non-US keyboard, use
<c>loadkeys</c> to load the keymap for your keyboard. To list the available
keymaps, execute <c>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</c>.
</p>

<pre caption="Listing available keymaps">
<comment>(PPC uses x86 keymaps on most systems. The mac/ppc keymaps provided
 on the Installation CD are ADB keymaps and unusable with the 
 Installation CD kernel)</comment>
# <i>ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now load the keymap of your choice:
</p>

<pre caption="Loading a keymap">
# <i>loadkeys be-latin1</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now continue with <uri link="#hardware">Extra Hardware Configuration</uri>.
</p>

<subsection id="hardware">
<title>Extra Hardware Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
When the Installation CD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware devices and
loads the appropriate kernel modules to support your hardware. In the
vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However, in some cases it may 
not auto-load the kernel 
modules you need. If the PCI auto-detection missed some of your system's 
hardware, you will have to load the appropriate kernel modules manually. 
</p>

<p>
In the next example we try to load the <c>8139too</c> module (support for 
certain kinds of network interfaces):
</p>

<pre caption="Loading kernel modules">
# <i>modprobe 8139too</i>
</pre>

<title>Optional: Tweaking Hard Disk Performance</title>
<body>

<p>
If you are an advanced user, you might want to tweak the IDE hard disk
performance using <c>hdparm</c>. With the <c>-tT</c> options you can
test the performance of your disk (execute it several times to get a
more precise impression):
</p>

<pre caption="Testing disk performance">
# <i>hdparm -tT /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

<p>
To tweak, you can use any of the following examples (or experiment
yourself) which use <path>/dev/hda</path> as disk (substitute with your
disk):
</p>

<pre caption="Tweaking hard disk performance">
<comment>Activate DMA:</comment>                                       # <i>hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda</i>
<comment>Activate DMA + Safe Performance-enhancing Options:</comment>  # <i>hdparm -d 1 -A 1 -m 16 -u 1 -a 64 /dev/hda</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection id="useraccounts">
<title>Optional: User Accounts</title>
<body>

<p>
If you plan on giving other people access to your installation
environment or you want to chat using <c>irssi</c> without root privileges (for
security reasons), you need to create the necessary user accounts and change 
the root password.
</p>

<p>
To change the root password, use the <c>passwd</c> utility:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing the root password">
# <i>passwd</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter your new password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter your password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
To create a user account, we first enter their credentials, followed by
its password. We use <c>useradd</c> and <c>passwd</c> for these tasks.
In the next example, we create a user called &quot;john&quot;.
</p>

<pre caption="Creating a user account">
# <i>useradd -m -G users john</i>
# <i>passwd john</i>
New password: <comment>(Enter john's password)</comment>
Re-enter password: <comment>(Re-enter john's password)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
You can change your user id from root to the newly created user by using
<c>su</c>:
</p>

<pre caption="Changing user id">
# <i>su - john</i>
</pre>

</body>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Optional: Viewing Documentation while Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to view the Gentoo Handbook during the installation, make sure you
have created a user account (see <uri link="#useraccounts">Optional: User
Accounts</uri>). Then press <c>Alt-F2</c> to go to a new terminal and log in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to view the documentation on the CD you can immediately run
<c>links2</c> to read it:
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the on-CD documentation">
# <i>links2 /mnt/cdrom/docs/handbook/html/index.html</i>
</pre>

<p>
However, it is preferred that you use the online Gentoo Handbook as it will be
more recent than the one provided on the CD.
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing the Online Documentation">
# <i>links2 http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-ppc64.xml</i>
</pre>

<p>
You can go back to your original terminal by pressing <c>Alt-F1</c>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>Optional: Starting the SSH Daemon</title>
<body>

<p>
If you want to allow other users to access your computer during the
Gentoo installation (perhaps because those users are going to help you
install Gentoo, or even do it for you), you need to create a user
account for them and perhaps even provide them with your root password 
(<e>only</e> do that <e>if</e> you <b>fully trust</b> that user).
</p>

<p>
To fire up the SSH daemon, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting the SSH daemon">
# <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
</pre>

<p>
To be able to use sshd, you first need to set up your networking. Continue with
the chapter on <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=3">Configuring your Network</uri>.
