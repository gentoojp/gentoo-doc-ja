<title>Mounting partitions</title>
<body>

<p>
When mounting an <c>ext2</c>, <c>ext3</c>, or <c>reiserfs</c> partition, you
have several options you can apply to the file <path>/etc/fstab</path>. The
options are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <c>nosuid</c> - Will ignore the SUID bit and make it just like an ordinary
  file
</li>
<li>
  <c>noexec</c> - Will prevent execution of files from this partition
</li>
<li>
  <c>nodev</c> - Ignores devices
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately, these settings can easily be circumvented by executing a
non-direct path. However, setting <path>/tmp</path> to noexec will stop the
majority of exploits designed to be executed directly from <path>/tmp</path>.
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/fstab">
/dev/sda1 /boot ext2 noauto,noatime 1 1
/dev/sda2 none swap sw 0 0
/dev/sda3 / reiserfs notail,noatime 0 0
/dev/sda4 /tmp reiserfs notail,noatime,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
/dev/sda5 /var reiserfs notail,noatime,nodev 0 0
/dev/sda6 /home reiserfs notail,noatime,nodev,nosuid 0 0
/dev/sda7 /usr reiserfs notail,noatime,nodev,ro 0 0
/dev/cdroms/cdrom0 /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto,ro 0 0
proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
</pre>

<warn>
Placing <path>/tmp</path> in <c>noexec</c> mode can prevent certain scripts
from executing properly.
</warn>

<note>
For disk quotas see <uri link="?part=1&amp;chap=5#quotas">the Quotas section</uri>.
</note>

<note>
I do not set <path>/var</path> to <c>noexec</c> or <c>nosuid</c>, even if files
normally are never executed from this mount point. The reason for this is that
netqmail is installed in <path>/var/qmail</path> and must be allowed to execute
and access one SUID file. I setup <path>/usr</path> in read-only mode since I
never write anything there unless I want to update Gentoo. Then I remount the
file system in read-write mode, update and remount again.
</note>

<note>
Even if you do not use netqmail, Gentoo still needs the executable bit set on
<path>/var/tmp</path> since ebuilds are made here. But an alternative path can
be setup if you insist on having <path>/var</path> mounted in <c>noexec</c>
mode.
