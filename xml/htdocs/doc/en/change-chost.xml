<p>
Changing the CHOST is a big issue that can seriously screw up your system - so
why is there a guide for that it at all?
</p>

<p>
There are certain situations where changing the CHOST is inevitable, e.g. if
you want to upgrade to glibc 2.4 which only supports nptl and you find out that
your CHOST is i386, which makes it impossible to use nptl. In this case, you
don't have a lot of options, and changing CHOST is one of them.
</p>

<p>
Even if following these instructions, problems may arise, so please make sure
you read and execute them very carefully. In this example the CHOST will be
changed from i386 to i686, if you do another change, please change the commands
accordingly.

<title>Changing the CHOST variable</title>
<section>
<title>Building the packages</title>
<body>

<p>
To start out with the CHOST change, edit the <path>/etc/portage/make.conf</path> file
and change <b>CHOST</b> value to suit your needs. Then, rebuild the following
packages in this order:
</p>

<pre caption="Rebuilding important system tools">
# <i>emerge -av1 binutils gcc glibc</i>
</pre>

<impo>
Please be aware that major gcc upgrades at the same time as changing CHOST
(e.g. starting with gcc 3.3, CHOST i386 and switching to gcc 4.1, CHOST i686)
can lead to severe side effects. While it may not be impossible to do so, it is
hard to predict which potential problems may arise and document them in this
guide. As a consequence, please do one thing at a time, e.g. upgrade gcc first
according to our <uri link="/doc/en/gcc-upgrading.xml">gcc upgrade guide</uri>
and change your CHOST afterwards. If you are on a system with CHOST=i386, you
will need to mask glibc 2.4 (or newer) during the gcc upgrade as it cannot be
used with i386 and unmask it once you're done.
</impo>

<title>Verifying things work</title>
<body>

<p>
Now it is time to make sure that your <c>gcc-config</c> and
<c>binutils-config</c> settings are sane and you do not have any leftovers in
<path>/etc/env.d/</path>.
</p>

<p>
The output of <c>gcc-config</c> and <c>binutils-config</c> should look like
this (may differ according to your gcc version and chost, gcc 4.1.1 and i686
here):
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying a sane setup">
# <i>gcc-config -l</i>
 [1] i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1 *
# <i>gcc-config -c</i>
i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1

# <i>binutils-config -l</i>
 [1] i686-pc-linux-gnu-2.16.1 *
# <i>binutils-config -c</i>
i686-pc-linux-gnu-2.16.1
</pre>

<p>
Next, check to see if there are references to the old CHOST in
<path>/etc/env.d/</path>:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking for old CHOST references">
# <i>cd /etc/env.d/</i>
# <i>grep 386 *</i>
05gcc-i386-pc-linux-gnu:PATH="/usr/i386-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1"
05gcc-i386-pc-linux-gnu:ROOTPATH="/usr/i386-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1"
</pre>

<note>
This may not happen to you, but in this case 05gcc-i386-pc-linux-gnu contains
references to the old CHOST. Things may look differently on your system
depending on which CHOST you are changing to/from, or even be just fine. The
name may also be 05gcc-your_new_CHOST-pc-linux-gnu.
</note>

<p>
Before deleting the file, let's check for files with the updated CHOST:
</p>

<pre caption="Checking for files with the updated CHOST">
# <i>grep 686 *</i>
05binutils:MANPATH=/usr/share/binutils-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.16.1/man
05binutils:INFOPATH=/usr/share/binutils-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.16.1/info
05binutils:LDPATH=/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib
05gcc:PATH="/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1"
05gcc:ROOTPATH="/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1"
05gcc:MANPATH="/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1/man"
05gcc:INFOPATH="/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1/info"
05gcc:LDPATH="/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1"
</pre>

<p>
This one looks good as there should always be only one file for <c>gcc</c> in
<path>/etc/env.d/</path> (05gcc in this example), so let's delete the one with
the wrong references:
</p>

<pre caption="Removing the files with incorrect references">
# <i>rm 05gcc-i386-pc-linux-gnu</i>
</pre>

<p>
The same also applies to <c>binutils</c> - if there's an extra one, see which
is the outdated one and delete it. Next, check your
<path>/etc/env.d/binutils/</path>
</p>

<pre caption="Checking for correct binutils">
# <i>cd /etc/env.d/binutils/</i>
# <i>ls -la</i>
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15 Sep  3 13:48 config-i686-pc-linux-gnu
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 126 Sep  3 13:48 i686-pc-linux-gnu-2.16.1

# <i>cat config-i686-pc-linux-gnu</i>
CURRENT=2.16.1
# <i>cat i686-pc-linux-gnu-2.16.1</i>
TARGET="i686-pc-linux-gnu"
VER="2.16.1"
LIBPATH="/usr/lib/binutils/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.16.1"
FAKE_TARGETS="i686-pc-linux-gnu"
</pre>

<p>
That one looks good, those two files actually should be there. Time to move on
to the gcc directory.
</p>

<pre caption="Checking for correct gcc">
# <i>cd /etc/env.d/gcc</i>
# <i>ls -la</i>
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  32 Sep  3 16:43 config
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  32 Aug  3 14:25 config-i386-pc-linux-gnu
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 292 Sep  3 16:43 i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1

# <i>cat config</i>
CURRENT=i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1

# <i>cat config-i386-pc-linux-gnu</i>
CURRENT=i386-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1

# <i>cat i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1</i>
PATH="/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1"
ROOTPATH="/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.1"
LDPATH="/usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1"
GCCBITS="32"
MANPATH="/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1/man"
INFOPATH="/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1/info"
STDCXX_INCDIR="g++-v4"
</pre>

<p>
<path>config</path> and <path>i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.1.1</path> are fine, but
<path>config-i386-pc-linux-gnu</path> is another leftover that needs removal.
</p>

<note>
Again, the name of the file containing references to an outdated gcc version
may have a different name, e.g. config-i686-pc-linux-gnu even though you are
changing to i686. It is important you identify the file on its content, not
only the name.
</note>

<pre caption="Removing the incorrect gcc config file">
# <i>rm config-i386-pc-linux-gnu</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now run the following commands to update your environment:
</p>

<pre caption="Updating the environment">
# <i>env-update &amp;&amp; source /etc/profile</i>
</pre>

<p>
Then verify everything is fixed:
</p>

<pre caption="Verifying refernces to the old CHOST are removed">
# <i>grep -r 386 /etc/env.d/</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you still find something, you must have missed some file, try to track it
down before going on.
</p>

<title>Finishing The Change</title>
<body>

<p>
Now it is necessary to re-emerge <c>libtool</c> and run
<c>/usr/share/gcc-data/$CHOST/&lt;gcc-version&gt;/fix_libtool_files.sh</c>. Make
sure to use the correct gcc version (your current one, 4.1.1 here, and the old
architecture, i386 here). Replace $CHOST with your new CHOST, and
&lt;gcc-version&gt; with your gcc version. This example assumes a CHOST of
i686.
</p>

<pre caption="Ensuring library sanity">
# <i>emerge -av1 libtool</i>
# <i>/usr/share/gcc-data/i686-pc-linux-gnu/4.1.1/fix_libtool_files.sh 4.1.1 --oldarch i386-pc-linux-gnu</i>
</pre>

<p>
You may want to rebuild all your packages:
</p>

<pre caption="Rebuilding world">
# <i>emerge -e world</i>
</pre>

<p>
Now, in theory it should not be necessary to do so, but it can not be 100%
guaranteed that this is actually the case. If you do not recompile the world
target, I have been told at least some packages need recompiling, so you should
do:
</p>

<pre caption="Remerging python">
# <i>emerge -av1 python</i>
</pre>

<p>
All packages using perl install to the CHOST directory and hence need
remerging. In case you haven't installed <c>qfile</c>, you will need to install
<c>app-portage/portage-utils</c> first.
</p>

<pre caption="Remerging perl packages">
# <i>emerge -av portage-utils</i>
# <i>emerge -av1 `qfile /usr/lib/perl* -Cq | sort -u`</i>
</pre>

<p>
If you encounter other packages that need recompiling, please let the author of
this document know.
</p>

<section>
<title>Common problems</title>
<body>

<p>
When upgrading from gcc 3.3 to 4.1 at the same time as changing the CHOST
(please don't do that anyway), a couple of users reported broken packages that
need recompiling, such as groff and courier:
</p>

<pre caption="Error messsage">
error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>
This happens because during the upgrade, the CHOST doesn't exactly match
CTARGET and the compiler assumes cross-compiling. As a consequence, LDPATH
isn't inserted into <path>ld.so.conf</path>, resulting in this error.
</p>

<p>
Please see our <uri link="/doc/en/gcc-upgrading.xml">gcc upgrade guide</uri>
for what needs to be rebuilt after a gcc upgrade.
</p>

<p>
In some rare cases, this can break old versions of python, too. This may be
fixed by adding <path>/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-linux-gnu/3.3.6</path> (change
accordingly to your old chost and gcc version) to <path>/etc/ld.so.conf</path>,
running <c>ldconfig</c> and then <c>emerge libstdc++-v3</c>. However, as you
can see, you really should avoid running into this problem - don't change CHOST
and your gcc version at the same time.
