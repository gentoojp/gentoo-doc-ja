<chapter>
<title>Upgrading to an unslotted MySQL version from a slotted one</title>
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
Due to the negative response from our user base, the MySQL team has decided to
go back to unslotted MySQL. In other words, installing different versions of
MySQL on the same system is not supported anymore.
</p>

<p>
If you had upgraded to the slotted version, this guide should help you upgrade
to the unslotted version.

<p>
The following script should do most of the work:
</p>

<pre caption='"Unslotting" script'>
<i>echo " building an unslotted copy of mysql "
emerge --buildpkgonly '=dev-db/mysql-5.0.18-r60'

echo " stopping the server  "
/etc/init.d/mysql stop

echo " removing most of symlinks "
eselect mysql remove

echo " config files "
mv /etc/mysql /etc/mysql.old
mv /etc/mysql-500 /etc/mysql

echo " removal of remaining symlinks, and eselect stuff "
rm /usr/lib/mysql /usr/include/mysql /usr/bin/mysql_config /usr/lib/libmysql*
rm -rf /var/lib/eselect/mysql/ /usr/lib/mysql-[45]0[01]

echo " unmerge slotted mysql "
emerge -C \
=dev-db/mysql-4.0.26-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-4.1.15-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-4.1.16-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-4.1.18-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.0.15-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.0.16-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.0.17-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.0.18-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.1.3_alpha-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.1.4_alpha-r30 \
=dev-db/mysql-5.1.6_alpha-r30 \
app-admin/eselect-mysql

echo " ready to merge again MySQL "
emerge --usepkgonly '=dev-db/mysql-5.0.18-r60'</i>
</pre>

<p>
It is also recommended that you move data directories listed in
<path>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</path>. If you do that, don't forget to edit
<path>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</path> as well.
