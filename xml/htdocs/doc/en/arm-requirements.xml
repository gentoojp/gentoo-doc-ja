<p>
The following table lists all the tested ARM CPU's and the systems
that they were found in.  Generally, if the CPU is supported, then
the system doesn't really matter.  The generic ARM target can (in
theory) run on any ARM CPU, it just won't be optimized for it.
</p>

<p>
Anything listed in [...] means it is in the works.  Anything listed
in (...) means it should work but no one has bother testing it.
