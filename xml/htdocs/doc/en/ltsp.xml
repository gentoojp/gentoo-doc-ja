<title>What is LTSP?</title>
<body>

<p>
LTSP is an abbreviation for "Linux Terminal Server Project". Installed
on a server it can supply many workstations (so called thin-clients)
with identical environments. All applications run on the server and
therefore you can use old PCs and convert them into XTerminals. This
reduces costs and maintenance especially in an environment where you
need to have an uniform workspace on each computer you login, e.g. in
schools or firms.

<section>
<title>Preliminaries</title>
<body>

<p>
All of the examples in this document presume that your server's IP is
192.168.0.254, your domain is named yourdomain.com and your network is
192.168.0.0/24.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Installation</title>
<body>

<p>
First of all, you must have a working Gentoo system. Please read the
Gentoo Installation Manual for your architecture on <uri
link="http://www.gentoo.org/doc">Gentoo's Documentation Website</uri>.
</p>

<p>
Then lets begin with the easiest step, installing the ltsp package:
</p>

<pre caption="Emerge LTSP">
# <i>emerge ltsp</i>
</pre>

<p>
This will install the following packages as dependencies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>XFree</b>: They are called XTerminals, guess why :)</li>
  <li>
    <b>DHCP</b>: DHCP is a protocol for automating the configuration of
    computers that use TCP/IP, used by ltsp to distribute IPs to the
    workstations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>NFS</b>: NFS is a protocol to allow access to harddisks through
    the network, used by ltsp to mount a base system for the
    workstations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>TFTP</b>: TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol, used by ltsp
    to transfer the kernel to the workstations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>XINETD</b>: Xinetd is a powerful replacement for inetd, with
    advanced features, used by ltsp to start tftp.
  </li>
</ul>

<note>
If you have the kde/gnome useflag set, it will also install a complete kde/gnome
system.

<chapter>
<title>Configuration</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
After the emerge process has finished all services must be configured:
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>System Logger</title>
<body>

<p>
To analyze problems easier, the system logger must be configured to
accept remote connections. Please read the documentation of your
system logger on how to achieve this. If, for example, you are using
sysklogd, all you need to do is edit <path>/etc/conf.d/sysklogd</path> and add
"-r" to the SYSLOGD line:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/conf.d/sysklogd">
SYSLOGD="-m 0 -r"
KLOGD="-c 3 -2"
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>NFS</title>
<body>

<p>
Next step is to edit your <path>/etc/exports</path> file, in order to
allow the workstations to mount the root filesystem. There should be at
least two lines in it:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/exports">
/opt/ltsp-4.1/i386         192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(ro,no_root_squash,async)
/var/opt/ltsp/swapfiles    192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no_root_squash,async)
</pre>

<note>
You have to alter the network/netmask to match your network/netmask
settings.
</note>

<p>
Now start NFS.
</p>

<pre caption="Starting nfs">
# <i>rc-update add nfs default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/nfs start</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>xinetd/tftp</title>
<body>
<p>
TFTP requires a bit of configuring to get it to work properly. First, edit
<path>/etc/conf.d/in.tftpd</path> to set tftpd's options and path correctly:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/conf.d/in.tftpd">
INTFTPD_PATH="/tftpboot"
INTFTPD_OPTS="-s ${INTFTPD_PATH}"
</pre>

<p>
The -s flag specifies that TFTP is to run in secure chrooted mode
(recommended). This means that you don't need to include the
<path>/tftpboot</path> path for example in the DHCP configuration.
</p>

<p>
Next, configure xinetd to run TFTP and allow remote connections. By default
TFTP won't be started by xinetd, so edit <path>/etc/xinetd.d/tftp</path> and
replace <c>disable=yes</c> with <c>disable=no</c>. If the file is missing just
go ahead and create <path>/etc/xinetd.d/tftp</path> with the contents below.
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/xinetd.d/tftp">
service tftp
{
        disable = no
        socket_type = dgram
        protocol = udp
        wait = yes
        user = root
        server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
        server_args = -s /tftpboot
}
</pre>

<p>
Now edit <path>/etc/xinetd.conf</path> and comment out the line <c>only_from =
localhost</c> by prefacing it with a <c>#</c>. Finally, start xinetd.
</p>

<pre caption="Starting xinetd">
# <i>rc-update add xinetd default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/xinetd start</i>
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Name resolving</title>
<body>

<p>
In order for the workstation to reach all resources, a correct name
resolving must be available. There are several ways to achieve this. One
is to configure a DNS server for the local network, the other (and more
simple) is to have almost identical <path>/etc/hosts</path> files on all
systems. We are going to use the latter.
</p>

<p>
All workstations must be listed in <path>/etc/hosts</path>. Take a look
at the example:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/hosts">
127.0.0.1        localhost
192.168.0.254    server      server.yourdomain.com
192.168.0.1      ws001       ws001.yourdomain.com
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>DHCP Config</title>
<body>

<p>
This is the most complicated step in my opinion, you have to create a
valid DHCP Config (<path>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</path>). Here is an
example:
</p>

<pre caption = "dhcpd.conf">
<comment>(Some general options)</comment>
default-lease-time            21600;
max-lease-time                21600;
use-host-decl-names           on;
ddns-update-style             ad-hoc;

<comment>(Bootp options)</comment>
allow booting;
allow bootp;

<comment>(Network Options)</comment>
option subnet-mask            255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address      192.168.0.255;
option routers                192.168.0.254;
option domain-name-servers    192.168.0.254;
option log-servers            192.168.0.254;
option domain-name            "yourdomain.com";

<comment>(LTSP Path Options)</comment>
option root-path              "192.168.0.254:/opt/ltsp-4.1/i386";
filename                      "/lts/vmlinuz-2.4.26-ltsp-2";
<comment>(Address of the tftp server to download the ltsp file from)</comment>
next-server                   192.168.0.254;

<comment>(If your workstations have ISA NICs uncomment the following)</comment>
<comment>(lines and alter the driver and IO)</comment>
#option option-128 code 128 = string;
#option option-129 code 129 = text;
#option option-128 e4:45:74:68:00:00;
#option option-129 "NIC=ne IO=0x300";

shared-network WORKSTATIONS {
  subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    <comment>(Distribute dynamic IPs to the workstations)</comment>
    range dynamic-bootp 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.16;
    <comment>(Workstation specific configuration for PXE booting)</comment>
    #host ws001 {
    #  hardware ethernet     00:E0:06:E8:00:84;
    #  fixed-address         192.168.0.1;
    #}
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
If your workstations support PXE, you should list each one of them as we
have done with <e>host ws001</e> (don't forget to uncomment it). Don't
give them an adress in the dynamic range, otherwise it would be possible
that more workstations have the same IP (which is troublesome). Remember,
if you cut-n-paste the above example, replace any "//" comments with "##",
or else dhcp will fail to start.
</p>

<p>
For more documentation on this item read the official dhcp handbook:
<uri>http://www.dhcp-handbook.com/</uri>
</p>

<p>
Now start DHCP as you did with NFS and xinetd:
</p>

<pre caption="start dhcp">
# <i>rc-update add dhcp default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/dhcp start</i>
</pre>

<note>
DHCPD needs CONFIG_PACKET and CONFIG_FILTER activated in the kernel to work.
</note>

<section>
<title>LTSP Configuration</title>
<body>

<p>
There are many options to configure your workstations, visit
<uri>http://ltsp.mirrors.tds.net/pub/ltsp/docs/ltsp-4.1-en.html#AEN1190</uri>
for a full description of <path>/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/lts.conf</path>.
</p>

<p>
As a few suggestions to get started, you will want to first copy
<path>/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/lts.conf.example</path> to
<path>/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/lts.conf</path> and edit it from there. You may want
to try changing the <c>SCREEN_01</c> option to read <c>SCREEN_01 = startx</c>.
To use a USB mouse on the remote client, add the following MODULE lines, and
change the X_MOUSE_* lines as follows:
</p>

<pre caption="/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/lts.conf">
MODULE_01          = usb-uhci
MODULE_02          = mousedev
MODULE_03          = usbmouse
X_MOUSE_PROTOCOL   = "IMPS/2"
X_MOUSE_DEVICE     = "/dev/input/mice"
</pre>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Displaymanager</title>
<body>

<p>
Now you have to change your displaymanager's configuration to
also accept remote connections.
</p>

<p>
First change your <path>/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess</path> file,
uncomment the following line:
</p>

<pre caption="/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess">
#*                   #any host can get a login window
</pre>

<p>
Now change the configuration of the displaymanager you use:
</p>

<p>
<b>XDM</b>: In <path>/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config</path> comment out
<c>DisplayManager.requestPort: 0</c>
</p>

<p>
<b>KDM</b>: In <path>/usr/kde/3.1/share/config/kdm/kdmrc</path> look
for the <c>[Xdmcp]</c> section and change <c>Enable = false</c> to
<c>Enable = true</c>.
</p>

<p>
<b>GDM</b>: In <path>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</path> look for the
<c>[xdmcp]</c> section and change <c>Enable = false</c> to
<c>Enable = True</c>.
</p>

<p>
Then start the displaymanager:
</p>

<pre caption="Starting xdm">
# <i>rc-update add xdm default</i>
# <i>/etc/init.d/xdm start</i>
</pre>

<warn>
There seem to be problems currently with XDM and GDM. The author used
KDM to resolve these issues.
</warn>

<p>
Remember, if your display manager is already running, restarting the X server
via CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE doesn't restart the display manager.
</p>

<title>Creating a bootfloppy</title>
<body>

<p>
If your workstations don't support PXE booting, you can create a boot-floppy
which is used to start your workstations and connect to the terminal server.
Go to <uri>http://www.rom-o-matic.net</uri>, select the latest version, select
your NIC, press <e>Get ROM</e> and write the image to a floppy:
</p>

<pre caption="Write floppy image">
# <i>cat nicfile.zdsk > /dev/fd0</i>
</pre>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> My workstations have Pentium II CPUs, but my server is compiled
with <c>march=athlon-xp</c>, does this work?
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> This is no problem, because all applications run on the server.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Which CPU and how much RAM should the server have?
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> There is a good document with suggestions at
<uri>http://wiki.ltsp.org/twiki/bin/view/Ltsp/ServerSizing</uri>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Do you have more information about this PXE stuff?
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> Yes, take a look at

which keeps the workstation connected to the network even when the power is
off."
