"The purpose of the new management structure was to solve chronic\n"
"management, coordination and communication issues in the Gentoo project. In\n"
"particular, we had no clearly defined top-level management structure, and no\n"
"official, regular meetings to communicate status updates between developers\n"
"serving in critical roles. In general, most communication took place on irc\n"
"and irregularly via email. There was also little to no accountability, even\n"
"at a high level, to complete projects on time.\n"

"Because of this prior state of affairs, it was difficult to set goals and\n"
"track the status of projects. This lack of communication and coordination\n"
"also made it difficult for top-level developers to manage their own\n"
"projects. In addition, we had other chronic problem of not having\n"
"clearly-defined roles and scopes of executive decision-making authority for\n"
"top-level developers, which resulted in many top-level developers doubting\n"
"that they even have the authority to manage their own projects and\n"
"sub-projects. While this had *never* been the intention of top-level\n"
"developers, it is the unfortunate result of an unstructured development\n"
"process: no one knew what was going on, and everyone deferred to the Chief\n"
"Architect for all executive decisions.\n"
