<p>
This is the status of the Gentoo Documentation Project. It will be posted
regularly, but not with a static frequency. All questions can be posted to
<mail link="gentoo-doc@gentoo.org">gentoo-doc@gentoo.org</mail> or to 
<mail link="swift@gentoo.org">me</mail> personally.
</p>

<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project, from now on abbreviated to GDP, has its own
project page (just like almost all other Gentoo projects). You can find it at
<uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp</uri>.

<chapter>
<title>New Year Goals</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
For 2005, the Gentoo Documentation Project will focus on the following goals.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Pull in developers/contributors</title>
<body>

<ul>
  <li>
    For the non-x86 installation instructions.<br/>
    Only a few developers are frequently busy with the installation 
    instructions and most knowledge is situated at the x86 instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the various projects that Gentoo is rich.<br/>
    There are quite a few guides that are project-specific and some projects 
    don't even have lots of documentation (if they have any at all). We should 
    be able to train interested developers in GuideXML so they can focus on the
    documentation of that particular project.
  </li>
  <li>
    For our own repository.<br/>
    New documents are always welcomed, but existing documentation must also be 
    maintained. 
  </li>
</ul>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Reintroduce Status Updates</title>
<body>

<p>
Check who is part of the GDP and require a monthly status update.
It seems that there are many developers "part" of GDP but their last
action (whether commit, bug resolution or something else) happened a long
time ago.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Improve documentation on GuideXML</title>
<body>

<p>
The Coding Style for GuideXML should be moved elsewhere as it isn't
really part of GuideXML itself. Improve descriptions as to "why" instead
only "how" (e.g. "&lt;abstract&gt;" is used to blabla).
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>"Writing Style" documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
For instance the AP Style Guide. Such document would explain how Gentoo
writes its documentation (capitalised titles or not, coding style, ...).
This enforces a bit more consistency across all documents.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Define Location of Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
This of course needs to be discussed with the various projects (probably
in gentoo-dev). We will need to list the pro/cons clearly before
attempting to create a definition/policy.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Audit the Existing Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
Verify if documentation is still valid, if no new way of handling things
improves the situation, whether there are spelling mistakes, ...
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>More USE-case Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
Documents such as the "Virtual Mailhosting Guide" are greatly
appreciated because they combine several existing projects in one.
Writing documentation on a single subject also happens at the
project-pages themselves (such as "CUPS", "Nano", "Vim", ...) but
combining projects (such as "MySQL + Postfix + ...") is rarely
documented.

<title>Gentoo 2005.0 Documentation</title>
<section>
<body>

<p>
<mail link="swift@gentoo.org">Sven Vermeulen</mail> has started with the 2005.0
specific installation instructions based on the feedback received from the <uri
link="/proj/en/releng">Release Engineering</uri> team. The draft installation
instructions are available in
<path>[gentoo]/xml/htdocs/doc/en/handbook/draft/2005.0</path> or online at <uri
