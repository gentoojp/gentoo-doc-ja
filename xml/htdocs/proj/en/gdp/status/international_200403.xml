<p>
The Gentoo Documentation Project, from now on abbreviated to GDP, has its own
project page (just like almost all other Gentoo projects). You can find it at
<uri>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gdp</uri>. 
</p>

<p>
GDP Lead Translators are kindly asked to post the status of their team every
month.  Those statuses will be summed up here monthly.  All questions can be
posted to <mail link="gentoo-doc@gentoo.org">gentoo-doc@gentoo.org</mail> or to
<mail link="neysx@gentoo.org">Xavier Neys</mail>.
